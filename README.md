# World Alcohol Consumption
This project explored alcohol consumption in countries around the world, based on a 2010 WHO study. Data for each country consisted of total liters of pure alcohol consumed and total servings of beer, wine, and spirits, respectively (all numbers are per capita for the year 2010).

Here are a few of our most interesting findings:

Belarus was the highest consumer of alcohol at 14.4 liters of pure alcohol per capita.

Beer was the most popular type of alcohol by servings, followed by spirits and then wine.

Unsurprisingly, Europe was the most popular region for wine.

Europe and North America drank the most alcohol.

Northern Africa and the Middle East consumed almost no alcohol.

We created a website with interactive visualizations of the data. To view the website on your local server:
1. Run the app.py file from your Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) window.
2. View the website in your browser by typing in the address that shows up in your Terminal/Git Bash when you run app.py. The address for your localhost is usually 127.0.0.1:5000
